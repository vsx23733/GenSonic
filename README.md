# Level Auto-Encoder for 2D Platformers

This project presents a specialized auto-encoder designed to process and reconstruct 2D platformer levels, with a focus on *Sonic the Hedgehog*. The tool facilitates the transformation of level images into structured data representations and vice versa, enabling advanced level analysis, generation, and AI-based testing.

## üîç Overview

The auto-encoder operates by:

- **Encoding**: Converting level images into a structured format using sprite tokenization.
- **Decoding**: Reconstructing level images from the structured data.
- **Analysis**: Providing tools for comparing original and reconstructed levels to assess fidelity.

This framework is adaptable to various 2D platformers, provided the necessary sprite data is available.
